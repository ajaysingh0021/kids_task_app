## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Users

1.  Visit the live demo link.
2.  Click on "Create one!" to register a new family account.
3.  Choose a unique Family Name and a 6-digit PIN.
4.  Go to the "Settings" page to add your children and their daily/weekly tasks.
5.  Share the Family Name and PIN with other family members so they can log in on their devices and see the same list!

### For Developers (Running Your Own Version)

If you want to host your own instance of this application, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kids-task-app.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kids-task-app.git)
    cd kids-task-app
    ```

2.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click "Add project" and give it a name.
    * Once created, go to **Project Settings** > **General**.
    * Under "Your apps", click the web icon (`</>`) to register a new web app.
    * Give it a nickname and click "Register app".
    * Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. **You will need this!**

3.  **Set up Firestore Database:**
    * In the Firebase console, go to the **Firestore Database** section.
    * Click "Create database" and start in **production mode**.
    * Choose a location for your database.
    * Go to the **Rules** tab and paste the following rules to allow authenticated users to read and write to the public data paths. This is crucial for the app to function.
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow public read/write for family account creation and task data
            match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * Click "Publish".

4.  **Configure the Application:**
    * This application is designed to be used in a platform that provides the Firebase configuration and App ID dynamically. If you are hosting it yourself, you will need to manually edit the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `Firebase Configuration` section in the `<script>` tag.
    * Replace the placeholder values with your own `firebaseConfig` object and a unique `appId`.

5.  **Deploy:**
    * You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser for local testing.
    * For public hosting, follow the deployment guide for a service like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
